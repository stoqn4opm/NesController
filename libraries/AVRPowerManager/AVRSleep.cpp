     * http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2486.pdf on page 35
     * there is a list of sleep modes which explains which clocks and
     * wake up sources are available in which sleep mode.
     *
     * In the avr/sleep.h file, the call names of these sleep modes are to be found:
     *
     * The 5 different modes are:
     *     SLEEP_MODE_IDLE         -the least power savings
     *     SLEEP_MODE_ADC
     *     SLEEP_MODE_PWR_SAVE
     *     SLEEP_MODE_STANDBY
     *     SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN     -the most power savings
     *
     * For now, we want as much power savings as possible, so we
     * choose the according
     * sleep mode: SLEEP_MODE_PWR_DOWN
     *

    // so sleep is possible. just a safety pin
    
    /* Now it is time to enable an interrupt. We do it here so an
     * accidentally pushed interrupt button doesn't interrupt
     * our running program. if you want to be able to run
     * interrupt code besides the sleep function, place it in
     * setup() for example.
     *
     * In the function call attachInterrupt(A, B, C)
     * A   can be either 0 or 1 for interrupts on pin 2 or 3.
     *
     * B   Name of a function you want to execute at interrupt for A.
     * execute code here after wake-up before returning to the loop() function
     * timers and code using timers (serial.print and more...) will not work here.
     * we don't really need to execute any special functions here, since we
     * just want the thing to wake up
     *
     * C   Trigger mode of the interrupt pin. can be:
     *             LOW        a low level triggers
     *             CHANGE     a change in level triggers
     *             RISING     a rising edge of a level triggers
     *             FALLING    a falling edge of a level triggers
     *
     * In all but the IDLE sleep modes only LOW can be used.
